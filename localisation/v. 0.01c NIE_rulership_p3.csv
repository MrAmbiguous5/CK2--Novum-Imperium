EVTDESC_NIE_231;A new day and a new problem has emerged. Your vassals have started a fierce quarrel over some judicary matter. [advise_one.GetTitledName] claims that your court judge made a huge mistake, during latest hearing. [advise_one.GetSheHeCap] says, that his verdict wasn't just, it was only good for the realm and for the treasury. [advise_two.GetTitledName] disagrees though - [advise_two.GetSheHe] thinks that only what is good for realm is just. You try to calm them, but they don't seem to listen to you. Your [spouse_one.GetHusbandWife] comes to your aid and proposes simple solution: 'Let me take care of this mess, my love' - [spouse_one.GetSheHe] says. 'I'll deal with them, while you can return to your duties'. You can either listen tou your [spouse_one.GetHusbandWife] or try to side with one of the vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
