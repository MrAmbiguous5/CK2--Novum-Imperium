EVTDESChafa.101;As you make your way through the woods on a minor hunting trip for rabbits, you come across an old man sitting outside of a humble cottage. By his side is a sword looking like none other you have ever seen. As you approach, he hails, "Hello there! My name is Rhydderch Hael!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhafa.101;What's that sword?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhafa.101;We're just passing by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAhafa.103;Take the sword, Dyrnwyn, and thank him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChafa.104;As you unsheathe the sword, the blade bursts into flames from the base to the tip! You look back to Rhydderch, but he is gone, and so is his cottage. All you see before you is a cleared section in the forest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhafa.104;Mysterious indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChafa.105;As I walk near the stream, a lost memory rushes to my mind filling me with a wondrous sense of lucidity. When I was just a newborn, I was taken in for a short period of time by fairies. Before they sent me on my way, they told me where they hid a magical artifact that would help me later in life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhafa.105;Yes! Underneath this rock!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
