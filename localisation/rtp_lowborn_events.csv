RTPlowborn_2_title;Adoption;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn_2_desc;While doing your duties, a [From.GetManWoman] by the name of [From.GetTitledFirstName] approaches you.  [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] has been watching me for quite some time now and [From.GetSheHe] would like to adopt me in [From.GetHerHis] family.;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.2_1;Thank you...[From.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.2_2;Sorry, my [From.GetLordLady] but I cannot accept.;;;;;;x

RTPlowborn_5_title;Learning how to Read;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn_5_desc;Lately I have become intrigued by the books and ledgers the priests and shopkeepers carry about. While it has been easy to make a few coins here and there, I can't help but wonder what more I could do if I knew how to read letters and figures like they do. Who knows -- with this I could even work for nobles themselves someday! I'll need some help, but I've become determined to learn.;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.5_1;I can finally read!;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.5_2;I didn't learn a damn thing.;;;;;;x

RTPlowborn_6_title;Learning how to Read;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn_6_desc;Several times now I have noticed [rtp_curious_ward.GetFirstName] watching me while I read aloud, and more than once [rtp_curious_ward.GetSheHe] even asked me what those funny scratches meant. "Can't you teach me?" [rtp_curious_ward.GetSheHe] keeps wanting to know. I hadn't considered it before, but the more I think about it the more I think might be able to do it. Now if only [rtp_curious_ward.GetSheHe] could sit still long enough to concentrate...;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.6_1;Good job [rtp_curious_ward.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;x
RTPlowborn.6_2;This kid is a loss.;;;;;;x
