SRR4_desc;The castle was abuzz with the strangest news. A farmer found a mutilated rooster in the woods near his field. The peasants think it is an ill omen. I try to ignore the gossip and get on with my day, but a feeling of dread follows me no matter what. "The peasantry is always superstitious, and always wrong," I mutter to myself. "I just need to set these feelings aside and move on." Then I see a beautiful young maid. "What a perfect distraction." I approach her and we begin to talk. We quickly hit it off and find a private place together to fool around. No matter what we do, I cannot get hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SRR4OPTA;Those damned peasants were right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Once we finish the incantation, I take the rooster out of its cage and slit its throat. Then, there's a gust of wind and I hear a voice say "It is done.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SRR5OPTA;May he suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SRR12_desc;My lover, [From.GetFirstName], seems to have been avoiding me recently. When I finally do get some time alone with him, I find he is unable to perform in bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SRR13_desc;When I meet with my lover, [From.GetFirstName], for our usual romp, I run out of steam halfway. After I explain my recent predicament, [From.GetSheHe] says, "If you can't perform, this relationship is over";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
