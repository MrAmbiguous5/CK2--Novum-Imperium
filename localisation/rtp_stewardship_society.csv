rtp_stewardship_india;The Gemstone Knights;;;;;;x
rtp_stewardship_india_desc;The Gemstone Knights have humble beginnings, their very name a sort of jest at their eschewing of war and other more “noble” pursuits. However, they are now a formidable presence. Having mastered the use of land routes via camel and coveted Indian Ocean routes by ship, the Knights control a large set of routes stretching from eastern Africa to Japan.;;;;;;x

rtp_stewardship_middle_east;The Karimis;;;;;;x
rtp_stewardship_middle_east_desc;Cities of the Islamic world need food and raw materials, while palaces, mosques, and aristocrats demand luxuries for displays of wealth and power. The Karimis, a large collective of merchant families and their trusted associates, are more than ready to supply.

rtp_stewardship_steppe;The Great Riders;;;;;;x
rtp_stewardship_steppe_desc;Originally breeders and sellers of horses, the Riders became more of a force in trade with the rise of demand for goods from China in the Middle East and Europe. Extremely loosely organized but highly territorial, they control a vast area of land and charge for both protection and for their consent of passing traders’ horses to graze. Sometimes they will strike a bargain with traders to carry goods in a sort of relay from rider to rider across the steppes, delivering the goods to a waiting hand in the cities. Of course, they charge dearly for this service as well.;;;;;;x

rtp_stall_warning_stewardship_mission_tooltip;Get the masons back to work;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.1_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] is having trouble with the local masons. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetTitledName] wants repairs to his castle and the masons have been stalling for months. Go meet with [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] and figure out what is going on.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.1_1;ACCEPT;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.1_2;DECLINE;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.2_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.2_desc;After a lengthy journey, I meet with [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] at a local inn. “They will not agree to the pay,” [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] tells me, sounding frustrated. “We negotiated their fee months ago! They agreed and now they are claiming I lied to them to try and get more out of me. It is outrageous!”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.2_1;Indeed it is.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.3_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.3_desc;The next day I pay a visit to the head mason, [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName]. “Surely you are joking. [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] lied to US! [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] agreed on a fee and now that it is time to start work [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] claims that [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] promised us half that fee. Half! We will not work for scraps!”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.3_1;A fair point.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.4_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.4_desc;Having heard both sides, now I must attempt to get one side or the other to agree with new terms.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.4_1;The steward is right.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.4_2;The masons are right.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.4_3;Try to compromise.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.5_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.5_desc;The next day I return to [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName], and sit him down. He is as obstinate as ever, and I know I must tread carefully.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.5_1;Come on. It is a tiny job, is it not?;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.6_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.6_desc;I return to [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] in the morning. [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] seems nervous, eager to get the building underway before [rtp_society_quest_target.GetTitledName] gets even more angry.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.6_1;These are men just trying to feed their families.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.7_title;Stall Warning;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.7_desc;I spend most of the night at the inn drafting new terms for the steward and the masons. Three drafts later and with the sun rising in the east, I think I have hedged the original deal enough to satisfy both.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.7_1;This should work.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.8_title;Stolen Goods;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.8.1_desc;I breathe a sigh of relief as [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] and [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName] seem to agree, finally. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetTitledName] will have his damned repairs done.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.8.2_desc;I grit my teeth as the masons still refuse to work despite my efforts. I make a note to be sure and spread the word of their stubbornness on my way home.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.8.3_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] must be the most stubborn man I have ever met. No matter what I try to negotiate, he just will not hear a word I say. There is no way the masons will pick up work now.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.8.4_desc;Neither of the two parties will settle for an equal outcome. Each of them want their way or the roadway.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.9_2;DECLINE;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.10_title;Fair Play;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.10_desc;The first merchant who comes to the table represents a circle of traders bringing expensive spices and silks from the East.

RTPssociety.11_desc;The second merchant has a large caravan transporting furs and wood from the far north. [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] seems wary of me, folding [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHis] arms as I speak.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.11_2;Charge [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHim] extra.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.15.1_desc;[Root.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName] tells me that [Root.Society.GrandMaster.GetSheHe] was very pleased with how I handled things! The fair will be a great success, I have no doubt.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.15.2_desc;[Root.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName] says [Root.Society.GrandMaster.GetSheHe] is furious at the taxes I charged. Apparently too many traders decided not to show and the fair was woefully empty.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.17_desc;I arrive at [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]'s manor after a long journey.

The more I get, the more you get.”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.17_1;I will handle it for you.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.18_title;Open to Offers;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.18_desc;I visit the first bidder, a [rtp_society_quest_target2.Religion.GetName] holy man. “Ah yes, those flowers. One of our brothers found that we can use them to make a salve that seems to help infections. Imagine how many lives we could save! We can only offer 100 gold but please, we could do much with them.”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.18_1;Indeed you could!;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.19_title;Open to Offers;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.19_desc;The second bidder is a wealthy merchant who serves me expensive wine. “You have seen the color of those flowers. I have someone who can make dye from them, for clothing befitting kings. We would make a fortune! I will pay 300 for the lot.”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.19_1;A tempting offer.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.20_title;Open to Offers;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.28_desc;A master of the Smithing's Guild is putting one of his journeymen through the Master's trial. They require our help in judging the man’s work. Go and give an opinion on the piece’s work, and whether this journeyman deserves the title of Master.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.29_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.29_desc;It is a long journey through rough weather, but finally I arrive in [rtp_society_quest_target.Realm.GetName]. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] greets me warmly and offers me a place to sleep in his home.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.29_1;Accept gratefully.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.29_2;Politely decline.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.30_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.30_desc;In the morning I am summoned to the guild hall, where several Masters and the young journeyman await. “Young [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] here will forge us a sword as we observe. I will have some wine brought.”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.30_1;Begin!;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.31_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.31_desc;It takes several days, all spent at the forge while [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] toils away under the hawkish eyes of the Masters. One evening as I am about to leave for the night, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] is waiting outside for me in the shadows.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.31_1;What is it?;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.32_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.32_desc;“I am an excellent crafter,” the young man says, after a nervous glance around. “One of the best. But I…” He sighs. “I was supposed to provide my own material for the forging. But I gambled most of it away last week. Stupid, I know. I had to buy inferior material to craft with. I had no choice!;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.32_1;I see.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.33_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.33_desc;I have done my absolute best with them. The pieces look fantastic. But I know someone with an eye like yours would be able to tell they are not worth what they should be. I want to make you a deal.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.33_1;You have my curiosity.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.34_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.34_desc;Tell them the pieces are good -- they are worth just what they would be if I would used the right material. You will get paid just the same from them, and I will pay you something extra.”;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.34_1;I will have to think about this.;;;;;;x

RTPssociety.35_title;Forged in Fire;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.35_desc;The day of judgment arrives. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] avoids my eyes as he brings the finished piece out and lays it down upon a rich cloth for the Masters to inspect. One by one they walk up and have their look, silent for now, then all attention is on me when it is my turn.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.35_1;The sword will not kill.;;;;;;x
RTPssociety.35_2;The sword will kill.;;;;;;x
