viceroy_government_desc;Viceroys are feudal lords who hold temporary titles at the discretion of their liege. Unlike normal feudal titles, viceroyalties revert back to the liege upon the death of the viceroy. Depending on the realm's laws, they may also be freely revoked at any point by the liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
