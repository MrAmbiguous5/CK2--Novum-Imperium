BM_LATER_LIANG;End of Tang Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LATER_LIANG_DESC;A dynasty which stood 289 years and presided over the Golden Age of China has come undone. Barely 19 days ago the last Emperor of Tang declared his abdication and passed on the ancestral seal to Zhu Quanzhong. A man who was granted by the previous Emperor a name 'fully loyal' now renamed himself Zhu Huang and wearing the golden cloth proclaimed the beginning of the state of Liang and the beginning of the new era 'Kaiping'. While many Jiedushi accepted his rise as inevitability, there are others who refuse to bow. In Hedong Shatuo under Prince of Jin Li Keyong declared allegiance to the Tang. In Qinfeng Prince of Qi Li Maozhen did the same. In Sichuan Prince of Shu refused to bow, but he has an ambition of his own... and in the far north Khitans under their dauntless leader bide their time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
