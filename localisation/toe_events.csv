#Autonomy Events
EVTDESC_toe.1050;My [Root.GetLordLady]!\nI have noticed your plight in the current war and would like to help you in the conflict. I will send you my finest men if you could grant me more autonomy to govern my province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1050;It is granted. I await your men on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1050;No, the realm is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1051;My [Root.GetLordLady]!\nI have noticed your economic plight and would like to help you in this matter. I will gladly send you a fine gift if you could grant me more autonomy to govern my province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1051;It is granted. I await your gift for the treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1051;No, the realm is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_toe.1053;Long Live the Emperor?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1053;The Emperor is dead.\nNow an heir has come to ask for your fealty. Will you kneel or are there more advantages to be had as an independent Lord?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1053;I will be a Vassal no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1053;They are my [From.GetLordLady];;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1054;To [Root.GetBestName],\nI [From.GetBestName] do hereby renounce my allegiance to your rule. I have chosen to assert my independence now and forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1054;That [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1055;To [Root.GetBestName],\nI, [From.GetBestName] do hereby accept your request for autonomy. I thank you for your previous service and wish you well in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1055;Thank you;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1056;To [Root.GetBestName],\nI, [From.GetBestName] do hereby accept your request for reintegration. I welcome you back into the empire with open arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1056;Thank you my liege;;;;;;;;;;;

#Empire Death Events
EVTDESC_toe.1151;The glory days of the empire are now long gone. While you are still afforded the courtesy of being called [Root.GetTitle], no King would accept to serve under you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1151;How the mighty have fallen...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1153;Your predecessors clung to an ancient title of Emperor without any right to such dignity. You have now managed to form a realm worthy of the name Empire and every ruler can see your glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1153;Like a phoenix from the ashes;;;;;;;;;;;


#Guard Events
EVTDESC_toe.1300;With the establishment of an Imperial Guard, you need to choose who will have access to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1300;Only natives of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1300;Both natives and foreigners;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1300;Only foreigners;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1301;From which land should these foreign guards come from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1301;The [first_pagan.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1301;The [second_pagan.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1301;The [third_pagan.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1301;The [fourth_pagan.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_toe.1302;A Tradition Started;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1302;You have managed to gather great soldiers from far and wide to serve as your personal bodyguard. From now on, any proud warrior's greatest ambition will be to serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1302;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_toe.1303;New Opportunities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1303_A;You receive news from [From.Capital.GetName]. It appears that [From.GetBestName] has decided to form a bodyguard with the strongest men in the world. Already many of your soldiers speak of one day joining such a prestigious order.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1303_B;You receive news from [From.Capital.GetName]. It appears that [From.GetBestName] has decided to form a bodyguard with the strongest men and women in the world. Already many of your soldiers speak of one day joining such a prestigious order.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1303_C;You receive news from [From.Capital.GetName]. It appears that [From.GetBestName] has decided to form a bodyguard with the strongest women in the world. Already many of your soldiers speak of one day joining such a prestigious order.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1303;Another chance for glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1308;[From.GetFirstName] comes to you one day. [From.GetSheHeCap] has heard great things about the [chosen_guard.GetName] and wishes to serve [emperor_of_guard.GetBestName] for some years.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1308;No, I need you here;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1308;Go forth to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1311;After several years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] has returned home with an increased knowledge of military matters.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1311;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1312;After several years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] has returned home with an increased desire to charge into battle in search of glory.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1313;After several years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] has returned home and seems increasingly impatient with occasional bursts of anger.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1313;I see...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1314;After several years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] has returned home and seems to have a clear path in mind for [From.GetHerHis] future.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1315;Many years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], have instilled [From.GetFirstName] with a clear method of work and organization that [From.GetSheHe] can use in all aspects of [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1316;Many years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], have instilled [From.GetFirstName] with a sense of self-importance that [From.GetSheHe] seems to cling to even now.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1317;Many years in the [chosen_guard.GetName], have filled [From.GetFirstName] with a certain disdain for the suffering of others.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1318;Since [From.GetFirstName] has returned from the [chosen_guard.GetName], [From.GetSheHe] has talked very little and will react with panic upon hearing certain sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1318;Are you ok...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1319;Upon [From.GetFirstName]'s return from the [chosen_guard.GetName], you notice that [From.GetSheHe] has brought back a [From.GetHusbandWifeOpp] for you to welcome into the family.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1320;Upon [From.GetFirstName]'s return from the [chosen_guard.GetName], you notice that [From.GetSheHe] has begun speaking of a new religion [From.GetSheHe] has encountered and chosen to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1321;Upon [From.GetFirstName]'s return from the [chosen_guard.GetName], you notice that [From.GetSheHe] has begun speaking fondly of a new religion [From.GetSheHe] has encountered but [From.GetSheHe] still seems to believe in your faith.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1322;Upon [From.GetFirstName]'s return from the [chosen_guard.GetName], you notice that [From.GetSheHe] has returned with a child! [From.GetSheHeCap] has not told you where the child came from but it appears not to be important.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1323;[From.GetFirstName] has returned from the [chosen_guard.GetName] but [From.GetSheHe] now asks for your permission to return and serve permanently in the [chosen_guard.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1323;Make your family proud!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1323;This is your true home;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1324;Your service in the [chosen_guard.GetName] has been cut short by the death of your predecessor. You must now leave the adventuring life and take up the mantle of leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1324;Home sweet home;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1331;Your Majesty,\nMy congratulations on your recent gains. I need to let you know that it is customary for the Emperor to reward the Guard for its loyal service of their predecessor. I think that the holding of [desired_barony.GetName] would be a good base for the Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1331;Of course!;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1331;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1331;You can build a new castle in [building_barony.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1332;Your Majesty,\nMy congratulations on your recent gains. I need to let you know that it is customary for the Emperor to reward the Guard for its loyal service of their predecessor. I think that funds for a new set of parade armour would be an appropriate donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1332;I'm afraid I don't have enough money;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1332;You can build a new castle for yourselves in [building_barony.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;


#Court Coup 
EVTDESC_toe.1500;The time has come to overthrow the Emperor. Join us at the Palace in the next days to strike the final blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1500;We are committed then...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1501;The day of the plot has finally come. You now have a choice on how to approach the Imperial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1501;We will block all escape routes before entering;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1501;We will storm the Palace before anyone has time to react;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1501;We will sneak into the Palace by taking advantage of the secret passages;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1501;We will order the Guard to march in and eliminate any resistance;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPA_toe.1501;Strategy is successful;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPB_toe.1501;Strategy is unsuccessful;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPC_toe.1501;Strategy is very successful;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1502;You are awakened in the middle of the night when a servant warns you that the Palace is under attack. Armed men are attempting to get in and you have precious few moments to decide upon your course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1502;I will try and hide as best I can;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1502;I will try and sneak out through the window;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1502;I will sneak out through the secret passages;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1502;I will call for my guards to protect me;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPA_toe.1502;Can you really trust the loyalty of your guards?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1503;You hear the conspirators enter the Palace. Loyal servants are being cut down in their attempt to buy you more time. What will you do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1503;I will hide and hope that nobody finds me;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1503;I will fight them like the [Root.GetManWoman] I am!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1503;The guard will deal with this rabble;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1504;Your accomplices have confirmed to you that the Emperor is still in the Palace. Now it's time to smoke [From.GetHerHim] out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1504;Search every corner of the Palace!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1504;Tell the guard to kill anyone inside;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1504;Contact your mole to direct you to the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1505;You have managed to escape the Palace and head out into the streets of the City. The night is dark any dangers abound, what is your next course of action?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1505;I will find some building to lay low until the morning;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1505;I will try to leave the city and reach my armies;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1505;I will go to the Guard's barracks;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1506;Your accomplices have informed you that the Emperor has escaped the Palace and is now somewhere in the city. [From.GetSheHeCap] must not be allowed to escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1506;Search every building in the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1506;Escape to your holdings before the Emperor can turn the tables;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1506;Contact your mole to direct you to the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1506;Have the Guard kill anyone they find outside;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1508;The plotters have managed to overpower you and capture you alive. You have no choice but to abdicate to [From.GetBestName] and wait to discover your fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1508;Blasted traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1508;I wish I were in [From.GetFirstName]'s shoes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1509;The plan was successful. You are now Emperor and you are faced with a choice on how to deal with your predecessor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1509;Send [From.GetHerHim] to a monastery;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1509;Make sure he bears no pretenders;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_toe.1509;Banish [From.GetHerHim] to a far off land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_toe.1509;Death is the only certain solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_toe.1509;It is best to prune the family tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1510;You have survived the night's ordeal and you are informed that the conspirators have been found and imprisoned. They are now at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1510;Hail me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1511;The plot to overthrow the Emperor has failed. You know when you have been defeated and surrender before being taken to the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1511;This won't be pretty...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1512;The plot against your power has failed but your men have been unable to capture the conspirators. They've fled to their respective holdings and now you must see if you will be able to arrest them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1512;I will have my vengeance;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1513;The plot to overthrow the Emperor has failed. When you saw the situation go South, you chose to flee the City and join the armies in your holdings. A civil war is more than likely at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1513;The tyrant may still fall;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1514;Your escape is cut short as an armed man approaches you. You are quickly overpowered as a horde of conspirators stab into your body until you stop moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1514;Aaargh;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1515;You manage to find the Emperor being set upon by one of your collaborators. You manage to also get a few stabs in before the deed is finally done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1515;Death to the tyrant!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1516;Your men take you to a room where you lay eyes upon the severed heads of the conspirators who attempted to unseat you. Now you can go on ruling more securely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1516;Good riddance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1517;Your plot has fallen apart, you hear guards searching for you and your collaborators. In a flash they cut down the men in front of you and you're next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1517;Aaargh;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

#Court Ritual
EVTDESC_toe.1600;In recent decades, the Court has become more and more powerful up to the point that, now, a formerly insignificant title has become one worthy of presiding at the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1600;I will have to find a suitable candidate;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1601;During a particularly long Court ceremony, you notice that [courtier_antagonist.GetBestName] seems distracted and is leaving you the perfect opening to get closer to the Emperor. Should you try and hope that [courtier_antagonist.GetFirstName] doesn't notice?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1601;I'm not throwing away this moment;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1601;The Emperor might notice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1602;During a particularly long Court ceremony, you notice that [courtier_antagonist.GetBestName] seems distracted and now [From.GetBestName] has taken [courtier_antagonist.GetHerHis] place of honor. How should you deal with this breach of protocol?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1602;[From.GetFirstName] seems like an enterprising [From.GetLadLass];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1602;[courtier_antagonist.GetBestName] should get [courtier_antagonist.GetHerHis] place back!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1603;It seems like the Emperor has taken note of you and approves of your audacity. He even takes you aside after the ceremony for a personal conversation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1603;I knew it would all pay off!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1604;During a particularly long Court ceremony, you dozed off for a moment and now [FromFrom.GetBestName] has stolen your place in the procession! Even worse, the Emperor seems to be giving them personal favors!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1604;That [GetRootFromFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1605;It seems like the Emperor has taken note of your behavior during the ceremony and greatly disapproves. He publicly chastises you and then takes [courtier_antagonist.GetBestName] aside for a private conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1605;That [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1606;During a particularly long Court ceremony, you dozed off for a moment and now [FromFrom.GetBestName] has stolen your place in the procession! The Emperor noticed this, however, and publicly chastised [FromFrom.GetBestName] before asking you to join [From.GetHerHim] for a private conversation!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1606;Justice!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1607;It is well known that your Emperor has certain specific tastes in bed and gossip has it that you might be the [Root.GetManWoman] to satisfy them. After tonight's banquet, the Emperor seems uninhibited enough to consider such a proposition...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1607;Make a move;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1607;This is beneath me!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1608;After tonight's banquet, you notice [From.GetBestName] looking hungrily at you. [From.GetSheHeCap] has recently had your fancy and you can't believe it when [From.GetSheHe] makes some rather indecent suggestions.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1608;Tonight is my lucky night;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1608;I'm not that kind of [Root.GetManWoman];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1609;You spend a very active night with [From.GetBestName]. In the morning, you feel that this experience has given you a certain leverage over your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1609;It was all worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1610;You made your suggestion to [From.GetBestName] but, unbelievably, [From.GetSheHe] refused! Your face glows bright red as you storm out of the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1610;That [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1611;You've spent some time around [visibility_courtier.GetBestName] and [visibility_courtier.GetSheHe] seems like the dependable sort. You know that [visibility_courtier.GetSheHe] would be very grateful to you if you gave [visibility_courtier.GetHerHim] your position of honor at tomorrow's ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1611;My dear [visibility_courtier.GetFirstName]! I have a proposal for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1611;[visibility_courtier.GetSheHeCap]'ll have to earn that place!;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Capri Events
EVTDESC_toe.1700;The stress of dealing with plots and government every day of your life is really starting to get to you. What is the point of ruling if you can't take some time for yourself. It might be best if you just found a secluded fortress and allowed yourself to just relax for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1700;I like the sound of that...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1700;No, my work is too important;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1702;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to realize that the pleasures of the flesh aren't really necessary and you can think a lot more clearly now.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1702;It was good to get out of the capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1703;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to realize that it isn't really possible to buy happiness. Much better to save money and ensure a better future for posterity.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1704;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to realize that it isn't really possible to buy happiness for you. Much better to give money to those less fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1705;In the days of your seclusion, you've been able to work on your passions without disctractions. This pleasant work has actually made you appreciate how rewarding it is to see a job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1706;In the days of your seclusion, you've had to often wait for information from the outside world. However, this has been an excellent exercise in patience that has made you less anxious about issues requiring your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1707;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to know your servants and guards quite intimately. Those people that used to be faceless to you now inspire you to improve their condition and give back emotionally what they give you materially.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1708;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to notice that the Empire has managed to survive without you. While once you felt that you were indispensable, you now understand that everything works due to your valuable collaborators.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1709;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to appreciate many of the more physical features of those around you. You've discovered several perks of being the Emperor that you had long neglected.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1710;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to appreciate the skills of the many cooks you brought with you. You've discovered that, with nobody around to judge you, you could eat all day.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1711;In the days of your seclusion, you've noticed all the little wasteful behaviors of your servants. This has convinced you that these people don't deserve your money and that they should leave it's use to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1712;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to appreciate the simple pleasure of doing nothing. You see that the Empire can run without you and you can easily spend an entire day in bed without anyone telling you off.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1713;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to notice many irritating details of those around you. You've started to beat servants just because of an irritating cough or annoying laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1714;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to notice how simple and carefree the lives of your servants are. You don't understand why they can just lounge around all day while you get reprimanded by your courtiers for every day you don't govern.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1715;In the days of your seclusion, you've come to much better you are than your servants. These people are ignorant and barely know the world outside their house while you have an entire Empire at your disposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1716;Your days of seclusion have lifted a heavy weight from your shoulders. For the first time in a long time, you are even considering returning to your normal duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1716;I can breathe easy again;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1717;Your days of seclusion have lifted a heavy weight from your soul. For the first time in a long time, you are even considering returning to your normal duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1718;You have decided to return to the capital and resume your duties as Emperor. As your grand welcoming parade enters the gates, you think to yourself if you might not regret this decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1718;I wonder what changed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Eunuch Events
EVTDESC_toe.1800;What skills are you looking for in this eunuch?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1800;Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1800;Martial;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA_toe.1801;Intrigue;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1801;Learning;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1802;A bright young man is brought before you. You are assured that he will be of the utmost usefulness.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1802;Let's hope so;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1808;By decree of [From.GetBestName], eunuchs have been officially integrated in the bureaucracy of the Empire and will be so forever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_toe.1808;Progress!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1808;Scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_toe.1809;With the prominence of eunuchs in the Imperial bureaucracy, many parents are deciding to make their youngest children into eunuchs in the hopes of improving their chances and opening access to special education. You've started to think that this could be a good direction for [target_child.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVTOPTA_toe.1809;I prefer a complete son;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_toe.1809;He'll thank me when he grows up;;;;;;;;;;;;
