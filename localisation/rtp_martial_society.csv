RTPmsociety.9_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.9_desc;Many days have passed since we set out on the road towards [rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName]. I walk a few paces behind [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName], keeping my eyes and ears trained on the quiet surroundings.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.9_1;My feet hurt.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.10_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.10_desc;As we round a corner I hear a voice call “You! Stop there!”. From behind a tree steps a young man, bow drawn. The tip of his arrow is aimed right for my face. Out of the corner of my eye I see a glint of metal.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.10_1;I will protect you!;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.10_2;This isn't worth my life.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.11_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.11_desc;Once the fool is lying dead in pool of [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] own blood, I wipe my sword on their ragged clothing. “Come on,” I tell [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]. “Let us get out of here.";;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.11_1;Let's hope there are no more surprises.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.12_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.12_desc;Just when we thought the remaining travel was going to be peaceful, an axe flies pass me and hits the wooden carriage.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.12_1;For fuck's sake what now.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.13_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.13_desc;As I draw my sword, the [rtp_society_quest_bandit3.GetManWoman] suddenly laughs and draws [rtp_society_quest_bandit3.GetHerHis] own! “So noble you all are” [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] says, beginning to circle me with sword at the ready. “But we will have your gold now. It is worth more than your empty honor.”;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.13_1;Are you going to talk all day?;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.13_2;It sure is!;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.14_title;Safe Passage;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.14.1_desc;We finally arrive at [rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName] and [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] tosses me a bag of gold. Smiling he tells me "For your troubles of course...you should consider mercenary work.";;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.14.2_desc;With the caravan raided and [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] dead, there really is not any point going any further. I decide to turn back empty handed.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.14_1;Maybe I will.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.14_2;But...my payment.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.15_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target2.GetFirstName] is offering pay for some help with a vassal. Says they are refusing to pay proper tithes. Do not kill the sod, but scare [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] enough to make them remember who their rightful liege is.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.16_title;Late Fees;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.16_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName] and I travel on horseback to the holdfast. We’ve taken care to put on our most fearsome-looking armor, and bring our most intimidating weapons. As we pass the main gate, peasants gasp and run at the sight of us.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.16_1;Away with you vile beggar.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.17_title;Late Fees;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.17_desc;We find our mark touring [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] fields, the sun beating down overhead. I nod to [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName] and we dismount, approaching [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] with our steps in unison. Through my visor I can already see [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] face grow pale. “You there! What do you want?” [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] calls out nervously.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.17_1;Were is the money [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.17_2;Oh you are about to find out.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.18_title;Late Fees;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.18_desc;Without wasting any seconds, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] throws the nearest chicken at us and hops the closest horse. Soon after [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] disappears in the shadows of the nearest forest.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.18_1;[Root.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName] isn't going to be happy.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.19_title;Late Fees;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.19.1_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] is quite nervous and I half expect [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] to wet [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerselfHimself] before we are through. Hands shaking, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] hands us several gold pieces to take back, and promises to return what they owe to their liege. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHeCap] seems to understand we will be back if [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] does not.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.19.2_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]’s jaw is set as we talk in circles trying to make [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] understand the situation. Finally, irked, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] points into the distance. “Pathetic louts, both of you! This is my land and you will leave at once!”. Armed citizens begin flocking behind [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.19_1;Smart choice.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.19_2;Fine...but this is not over.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.20_title;Late Fees;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.20.1_desc;It takes only a few well-placed blows about the [rtp_society_quest_target.GetManWoman]’s head and stomach before [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] is on the ground gasping for mercy. “Stop! I beg you, stop! The money shall be at my liege’s doorstep by sundown, I swear to you!”;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.20.2_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] is stronger than I had anticipated. Several blows do little to sway them, and rage glints in [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] eyes as they shout, “Brigands, the lot of you! How dare you? Get off my land this instant before I call my guards!”;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.20_1;It better be.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.21_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName] arrived screaming and crying to the lodge. [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetSheHeCap] said that [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetHerHim] [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHusbandWife] needs a champion in order to fight for [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHim] in a trial by combat.

RTPmsociety.22_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName] rushes me with a face filled of tears. “Please, you must help me. My [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHusbandWife] faces trial by combat, and barely knows how to use a sword. [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetSheHeCap] is an innocent man! I have no one else to serve as [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHis] champion...I beg you, help us. I assure you I can pay.”;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.22_1;No one else at all uh?;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.23_title;The Champion;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.23_desc;I arrive at the holdfast at dawn. My charge sits huddled by a downtrodding-looking man in heavy shackles. Much of the village has already gathered, and I hear whispering as they realize I am the one who stands for [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHim]. I have no time to contemplate any further, as my towering opponent casts a shadow on my face.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.23_1;Lets get this over with.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.23_2;I am not fighting that brute.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.24_title;The Champion;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.24.1_desc;As I stand triumphant, feeling warm blood drip down my cheek, the [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetManWoman] begins to weep with relief. Grumbling, the prison guard fumbles with his keys for longer than necessary before he unlocks the stock.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.24.2_desc;I hunch on the ground, feeling blood dripping from beneath my armor. Somewhere to the right I hear [rtp_society_quest_target3.GetFirstName]’s terrified wailing as my defeat seals her husband's conviction.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.24_1;Pay up.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.24_2;Seems that [rtp_society_quest_target2.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] does not favor [rtp_society_quest_target2.GetHerHim].;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.26_title;Bounty Hunter;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.26_desc;It has taken me several days, but finally I pick up the [rtp_society_quest_target.GetManWoman]'s fresh tracks in the woods. When I see [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] I call out, raising my weapon, “Stop right there criminal scum!”. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHeCap] springs up, drawing [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] own sword angrily stating "You better not be a manhunter!";;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.26_1;You violated the law.;;;;;;x
RTPmsociety.26_2;Me? A manhunter? Nahhh.;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.27_desc;As I look at [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] lying on the ground, face twisted in pain, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] lifts a hand. “Listen, I can pay. More than what they are giving you. Let me go and we can work this out…;;;;;;x

RTPmsociety.28_desc;The [rtp_society_quest_target.GetManWoman] pulls a gold chain from inside [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] mail, slipping it off over [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] head.
