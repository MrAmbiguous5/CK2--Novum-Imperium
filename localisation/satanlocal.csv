SATANIC_CRUSADE_SATAN;For some time now there has been a feeling of electricity in the air, along with a constant strange murmuring, distant and unintelligable, yet nevertheless lingering, as though it were carried by the breeze. Many local peasants and artisans have complained of animals behaving strangely, with otherwise peaceful creatures turning aggressive and savaging humans and other animals alike. These anomalies recently ceased, however the Listener of our faith after days of isolation has declared that the Great Unholy One, Lucifer himself, had been communicating his desires for the material world, decipherable only by the Listener. Lucifer's commands have since been known: All followers are to embark upon a crusade for the [From.GetFullBaseName] as soon as possible, with the main combatant being granted new lands for rape, plunder, and gradual enslavement...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SATAN_DEMON_SUMMON_TITLE;Great Summoning;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_DEMON_SUMMON_DESC;Your priests have been working tirelessly for the past three days in order to prepare for a summoning not yet seen by the world. A gigantic space has been cleared in your castle's cellar, and various foreboding items appear arranged in a chaotic yet delightfully decadent manner. Severed goat heads and human genitalia mounted on effigies of bloated, diseased cadavers line a central ring, containing what appears to be a pentagram, yet warped as though reality itself had been bent. The only matter left to decide is which demon to invoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SATAN_WROTH_DEMSUM;Summoning of Abaddon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_WROTH_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your priests begin the invocation of Abaddon, first by chanting from the Unholy Scriptures, then by engaging in ritualistic violence with fellow onlookers. The walls of the cellar begin to bleed, and some priests break down into uncontrollable fits of violent motion. Your sacrifice is briskly led into the circle, and with a swift move of your hands their neck is snapped. The corpse begins writhing and exuding otherworldly speech, and moments later is transformed into a large, crimson-scaled demonic being.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_WROTH_DEMSUM_OP;You serve me now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_GLUT_DEMSUM;Summoning of Beelzebub;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_GLUT_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your priests begin the invocation of Beelzebub, first by chanting from the Unholy Scriptures, then by feasting on all of the food your realm had to offer. Your entire court is indulged in a gigantic feast, with the unwitting sacrifice being fed most. Once full, they are led into the circle and gutted at the stomach, entrails and partially digested food scattering across the pentagram. The disemboweled corpse then begins a transformation into a bulging, grotesque demon. It's clear that this is Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_GLUT_DEMSUM_OP;You serve me now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_ENVY_DEMSUM;Summoning of Leviathon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_ENVY_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your priests begin the invocation of Leviathon by chanting from the Unholy Scriptures. The words seem to resonate throughout the chamber, in greater and greater volume, until finally they can be heard as a perpetual echo without any input from you or your followers. The sacrifice is led into the circle and their throat is cut. Strangely, the blood clings to the lines of the pentagram as it floods outwards, and soon begins glowing. Not long after, Leviathon, shorter than you expected and with dark, untelling eyes, stands before you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_ENVY_DEMSUM_OP;You serve me now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_PRIDE_DEMSUM;Summoning of Adramelech;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_PRIDE_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your priests begin the invocation of Adramelech by chanting from the Unholy Scriptures. A statue of the Demon himself, prepared by the finest artisans you could enthrall, is then placed within the room's central pentagram. The sacrifice is subsequently led to a position below the statue's knees, and their throat is cut. A wave of infernal roaring and cheering sweeps through the chamber, and from the ruins of a human body, Adramelech materialises in all his resplendent glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_PRIDE_DEMSUM_OP;You serve me now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_GREED_DEMSUM;Summoning of Mammon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_GREED_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your followers begin invoking the Demon Mammon via chants provided within the Unholy Scriptures, additionally a huge mound of gold, trinkets (and anything valuable you could find) is offered up to the lord. After the invocations, a sacrifice is led into the circle and killed, with the resultant blood drained over the pile of gold. As though the blood were beyond boiling point, the gold begins to liquify and gradually takes the shape of Mammon. Shrewd and cunning, like a rat, Mammon stands before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SATAN_LUST_DEMSUM;Summoning of Asmodeus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_LUST_DEMSUM_DESC;You and your priests begin the invocation of Asmodeus, and although it's rather pure at first, it soon devolves into an orgy of debaucherous activity with dozens of courtesans and courtiers. Midway through, you lead your sacrifice into the circle and, with a swift motion, slash their throat with a ceremonial dagger. Asmodeus subsequently assumes control of the empty vessel and presents himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_LUST_DEMSUM_OP;You serve me now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_AAMON_DEMSUM;Summoning of Aamon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SATAN_AAMON_DEMSUM_DESC;The invocation of Aamon begins, with the incantations read aloud by yourself from the Unholy Scriptures. Your subjects follow your chanting, awaiting the majesty of Aamon's presence, and gradually a darkness grows from the centre of the pentagram. It seems to suck the light, and even sound, from the room, so that none may converse and focus is solely concentrated on the void. In silence, you slash your sacrifice's throat and let their blood drain into the abyss. Not long after, a monumental being, timeless in its splendor, emerges from the void.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Using the gold you provided, he has acquired all necessary equipment for the ritual.
