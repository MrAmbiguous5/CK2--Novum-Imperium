To change preset copy the default.map file from the appropriate folder within the Options folder to the map folder.

Description:

Pharaohs Canal - Merges Atlantic/Mediterranean with Indian Ocean, Changes eastern branch of nile into sea, allows all ships to travel between on said branch.

Contiguous Caspian - Allows for travel into and out of Caspian Sea along Volga river.
	With Ports - Allows for ports by changes Southern 2 Volga and Don river provinces into sea provinces. Meaning all ships can sail along them into and out of the Caspian (Like Other MNR Versions).
	Without Ports - Treats Caspian Sea as major river (Like Vanilla).
	
Separate Ocean Caspian - Does not allow for movement into and out of the Caspian Sea along Volga by keeping Caspian in separate Ocean Region.
	With Ports - Adds ports for internal use (Like CK2Plus).
	without Ports - Treats Like River (Not Included) (Like Base SWMH).

Note:
As of 3.3 Merchant Republics still do not understand rivers. As such any path between 2 ports that does not have a direct sea province route (not traveling along rivers) will result in a negative distance penalty for the cost of building Trade Posts.
If this bug is fixed I intend on greatly simplifying the current preset options.
