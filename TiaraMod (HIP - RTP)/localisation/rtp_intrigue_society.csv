RTPisociety.12_desc;Listen up. One of your idiot [rtp_society_quest_target.GetBrotherSister] has been caught by the guards during a job, and the rest of us could be in danger. Get them out of that prison before the guards get a chance of questioning [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.13_1;We should sneak in through a back way.;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.13_2;One of us should run a distraction on the guards.;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.14_title;My Brother's Keeper;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.14_desc;[rtp_society_quest_helper.GetFirstName] and I wait until the cover of darkness and slip into the damp prison. Shadows cover us, the quiet drips of dank water masking our quiet steps.;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.15_desc;I crouch atop a beam high above the guards’ heads, watching their movements. When is spot a glint in thicket, the sign from [rtp_society_quest_helper.GetFirstName], I raise my bow and fire an arrow into the bushes. The noise startles the guards, who instantly begin searching the grounds.;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.15_1;How dumb could they possibly be?;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.16_title;My Brother's Keeper;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.16.1_desc;We’ve done it! We made it back out of the prison before daybreak, our [rtp_society_quest_target.GetBrotherSister] in tow. We stay silent until we’re well away from the dungeon, making it back to our cellar before the cry is raised.;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.16.2_desc;The minutes pass and we still haven’t found [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]. “This is the right cell, I swear it,” hisses [rtp_society_quest_helper.GetFirstName] as we come to an empty block. “They must have moved [rtp_society_quest_helper.GetHerHim]!”;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.19_1;And the wine of course.;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.20_title;Assassination;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.20_desc;Blended into the crowd, I have an easy time following [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]. As [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] turns down the alley I glance around quickly then make my move.;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.21_title;Assassination;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.21_desc;In place in a narrow wedge between buildings, I wait until I spot my target about to walk by. “My [rtp_society_quest_target.GetLordLady]!” I pitch my voice up from the dark corner. “Please, please...I am wounded, would you help me?;;;;;;x

RTPisociety.23.3_desc;My arm wrapped around [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]’s neck, hand closed around [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] mouth, and my dagger glints as I slip it deftly into [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] back.;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.23.4_desc;As I grab for [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]’s mouth to hush them, an elbow cracks into my nose, sending my head flying back. A cry goes up and I turn, stumbling quickly away before I am caught.;;;;;;x
RTPisociety.23.5_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] can’t resist the cries of the downtrodden.

RTPisociety.23.6_desc;I watch, fists clenched as [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] peers into the alley way, then turns away without bothering to see where the pathetic voice has come from.;;;;;;x
