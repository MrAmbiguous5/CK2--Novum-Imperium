hist_york;Blood of Edmund Langley;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_york_desc;This character is descendant of The House of York, a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century.

It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with the House of Lancaster, it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_howard;Blood of Hereward the Wake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_howard_desc;"This character is a proud descendant of The Howard family - an English aristocratic family founded by John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, in 1483. After the English Reformation many Howards remained steadfast in their Catholic faith as the most high profile recusant family. The Howards claim as their ancestor Hereward the Wake who was of local Mercian background and resisted the Norman conquest of England from his base at the Isle of Ely; he has since become a mainstay of English folklore. It is claimed that he was the son of Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. Ultimately this ancestry traces back to a point of origin in Leicester. While legendary pedigrees trace the family to the 10th century, indisputable descent begins with Sir William Howard (died 1308), a judge who was in the House of Commons in the Model Parliament of 1295.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_percy;Blood of William de Percy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_percy_desc;The House of Percy were the most powerful noble family in northern England for much of the Middle Ages, having descended from William de Percy (d.1096), a Norman who crossed over to England after William the Conqueror in early December 1067, was created 1st feudal baron of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, and was rebuilding York Castle in 1070. The name derives from the manor of Percy-en-Auge in Normandy, the home of the family at the time of the Norman Conquest. Members have held the titles of Earl of Northumberland or Duke of Northumberland to this day, in addition to Baron Percy and other titles. In common with their rivals, the House of Neville, the Percy surname twice died out in the male line but was re-adopted by the husband of a Percy heiress and by their descendants. In the 12th century, the original Percy line was represented by Agnes de Percy, whose son by her husband Joscelin of Louvain adopted the surname Percy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_neville;Blood of Uthred;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_neville_desc;The House of Neville is a noble house of early medieval origin, which was a leading force in English politics in the later Middle Ages. The family became one of the two major powers in northern England along with the House of Percy and played a central role in the Wars of the Roses. The family can be traced back to one Uhtred, whose son Dolfin is first attested in 1129, holding the manor of Staindrop in County Durham. In the 16th century the Nevilles claimed that their ancestor Uhtred was descended from Crinan of Dunkeld, ancestor of the Scottish royal House of Dunkeld. As well as prestigious ancient connections with the royal families of both England and Scotland, this claim entailed a line of descent from the Bamburgh dynasty of Earls of Northumbria, attaching the Nevilles later power in the north to a pedigree of pre-eminence in the region stretching back at least as far as the early 10th century. Nevilles became the most important supporters of the Yorkist pretender to the throne Richard, Duke of York during the early stages of the Wars of the Roses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
