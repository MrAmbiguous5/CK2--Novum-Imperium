RTPreligion_2_title;Schism;;;;;;x
RTPreligion_2_desc;We all knew this day would happen - The day when Western and Eastern Christianity would split from each other and become their own entities.  The schism between the Western and Eastern Mediterranean Christians resulted from a variety of political, cultural and theological factors which transpired over centuries and finally reached its boiling point.  The new Western Church is being named Catholicism and led by [rtp_catholic_leader.GetTitledName], while the Eastern Church is being named Orthodoxy and led by [rtp_orthodox_leader.GetTitledName].;;;;;;x
RTPreligion.2_1;I will follow [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] decision.;;;;;;x
RTPreligion.2_2;[rtp_catholic_leader.GetTitledName] is right!;;;;;;x
RTPreligion.2_3;[rtp_orthodox_leader.GetTitledName] is right!;;;;;;x
RTPreligion.2_4;Easier pickings for us!;;;;;;x
