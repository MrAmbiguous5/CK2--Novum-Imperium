EVTDESCPDP.122;The votes have been counted, but again, no one has a majority of more than [global_PDP_half_number_votes.GetValue] votes.

EVTDESCPDP.124;After a long night, [PDP_widthdrawed_cardinal.GetTitledName] decided that only getting [PDP_widthdrawed_cardinal.PDP_votes_for_me.GetValue] votes in the last round of election clearly shows, that he is not meant to become Pope yet.

EVTDESCPDP.124Absent;A letter arrived from [PDP_widthdrawed_cardinal.GetTitledName]. Being absent and not having many supporters in the curia, he doesn't believe that he has a chance.

There will be those who still cling to it, but they will be few in number and the Papacy can once more claim universal rule over all of Christendom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

succ_playable_catholic_bishopric_desc;If the title has Free Investiture, the lieges vote dominates. Otherwise the Pope has more influence. Making someone Bishop Coadjutor helps him to get more votes. Keep in mind that you can try to bribe your liege and religious head. This will grant bonus score for your candidate. Check out the detailed elector panel to see who is voting for which reasons. Electors that owe you a favour will be more likely to vote for your candidate as well. Another way to get a higher chance for you character is to spend church influence (up to 4 times, increasing cost) in the church interface. \nIn case they are still not voting for your relative, somebody might have to... go to heaven a bit sooner than expected. \nAlso the difficulty (game rule) plays some part (up to +150). You can change it with save game editing, if you need to. \nOnly adult males can be elected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
