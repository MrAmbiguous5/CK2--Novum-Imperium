EVTDESC_PDPTUT.1;Welcome to the Playable Dynastic Theocracy Mod. Are you familiar with how this mod works and which changes are made to the papal and theocratic successions? For more detailed information, take a look at the mod's workshop page or the forums.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_a_PDPTUT.1;I am omniscient. Go away, foolish popup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_b_PDPTUT.1;I'm new to this and would like some information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_c_PDPTUT.1;I just want to know about how the papacy works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.10;This mod focusses on dynastic theocracies. Unless you have changed the game rules accordingly, not having an heir of your dynasty will cause a game over. In case your character has no dynasty (lowborn), there's a decision to create one. Use it.After that, you may use the <Spawn Family> decision, if you haven't disabled it with a game rule or already have a large dynasty. It will create a father, brother and might create a nephew, too.And/Or: Use seduction to get yourself a family. That's the true way to handle it: Starting from nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.11;There's no guarantee that the pope / your liege will vote for somebody of your dynasty as your successor - if your heir is particulary bad and the AI hates you, they will probabily not vote for him even if you bribe them... But if you kill the other candidates, the electors have not much of a choice. What a smart move... It's not problematic to loose your title - if you've set up your dynasty in other places. Grant titles to your dynasts, to make sure there's always a living playable dynasty member. Setting up a feudal ruler of your dynasty could be helpful as a fallback option, since he's much more likely to keep the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.12;Elective Investiture: Only 1 of the electors has a significant amount of voting power. That is, depending on your investiture law, the pope or your liege.Electors like learning, piety, good traits, etc. They don't like people of your dynasty (except they are dynasts) that much. And they really don't like incompetent nephews.What makes electors vote for your candidate: All kinds of shiny stuff. Land is good too. Just talk to them. A good opinion generally helps. Also, making your 'heir' Bishop Coadjutor (ask pope or liege) helps. Bribing and church influence is another way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.13;Theocracies have access to CBs similarly to those of the Merchant Republics. They can declare a war for a bishoprics of neighbouring countries, and if they already control one in a province, for the whole county (you must declare on the province owner). This allows some kind of power struggle with feudal rulers. Of course you cannot use this CB against other fellow theocracies, since their land already belongs to the church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.131;The Church Interface: Next to the minimap is a little button with a papal hat.    No, there is no button?! That's probably due to you being under the rule of an antipope, not catholic, or outside of the diplomatic distance of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.132;What is Church Influence? It is a new currency of this mod. You gain it on a monthly basis, based on your rank in church and your skills. You can spend it to help relatives into offices, gain some little benefits or straight up suggest yourself for the office of cardinal. You can also make use of it during papal elections to ask other cardinals to vote for you. A major use is the voting system: Initiating a proposal costs you church influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.14;What are proposals? The church has different policies and statuses. Statuses do change on their own, from time to time. Policies can be changed by proposing to change the policy to some other policy. Different policies allow different means to gain more influence. Can the AI use the voting system? Yes, the AI will use the system on its own. It will vote somewhat logically and also make proposals, if it can. The AI also uses its church influence for other interactions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.15;Antipopes:Fight against the Antipope: When someone proclaims an antipope, every direct vassal of this realm can revoke his oath and fight as a rebel for the Pope in Rome immediatly. So when choosing this option as a cardinal, you will not loose your job (technically there's a 1 day window in which you could be fired, but that's very unlikely). All AI vassals will decide which Pope to support based on their opinions of the pope, antipope and liege lord (and a fair bit of randomness). Also, nearby catholic realms also get prompted and have the option to join the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.16;Becoming Cardinal:    Although the religious screen will not show you as <your best candidate> when it comes to the appointment of the next cardinal, the money you spend in your campaign fund will count towards your personal cardinal score as well. So if you are better than your best candidate and spend enough money, you will become the next cardinal. The game correctly displays the next cardinal.    The AI does not recognize that you are well suited? If you have the required amount of church influence and there is an empty seat (might have to help with that one), you can request to become cardinal yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.17;Papal Succession: When the pope dies, all cardinals get an invitation to Rome. There they meet in the conclave and vote for a new pope in multiple rounds, until one of them gets a majority and becomes pope, gets coronated and holds a mass. Then everybody goes home again. While you and the other cardinals go on discussing who should be the next pope, there has to be someone holding the title of the Papacy and doing the day to day activities: The Holy See himself. \n IMPORTANT: If you played the last pope, you will continue as a landed relative - so you need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.18;Voting: 10 days after the conclave starts, the first round of election will take place. In order to cast your vote, you can use a targetted decision. You'll be informed of the results by events and you can see the votes a cardinal got in the last election in a tooltip of the <In conclave> trait. An AI cardinal will vote for himself if he is preferatus or got a large amount of votes for himself in the last election or is ambitious. If they have promised to vote for you, they will do so. Otherwise, the AI will pick its candidate based on dynastic relations, friendship, love, opinion, learning and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.181; In order to win an election, you will need an absolute majority (e.g. 5 out of 9). In case no one got a majority, the next election will take place a few weeks to months later.Giving up: After each unsuccessful election, there's a chance (pretty high, scaling down with the number of votes they got) for one cardinal with the least votes to widthdraw from the election. No one will be able to vote for him anymore. If you use the self interaction to not become pope, no one will vote for you either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PDPTUT.19;In between elections, you can ask other cardinals to vote for you. They will only listen to your offer, if they don't pursue the Throne of St. Peter themselves. In case they like you enough, they will accept, and/or ask you to pay them for their vote. This will cost you a lot of money, so keep in mind that you might have to bribe 4 other cardinals to get the majority. You can also give away your titles. Keep in mind that you need church influence in order to ask people to vote for you so you should probably save up some influence in advance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
