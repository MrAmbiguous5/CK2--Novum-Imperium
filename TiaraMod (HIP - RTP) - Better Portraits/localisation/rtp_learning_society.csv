RTPlsociety.16_desc;When dogs are fighting over a bone, take the bone and they will stop. Just like the flock of ravens that has descended on this land to peck up every speck of gold and silver. [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] shows no mercy, and the sinners' hearts are poisoned by covetousness. They would do everything in order to achieve their goals! You want to wealth? Sin and you will have it!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.16_1;But at what price!;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.17_title;Drinking with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap];;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.17_desc;Your chances of salvation are gone as soon as you even speak to such creature. Look to your consciences, you robbers of the poor, for you are constantly watched by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.17_1;Pray every night for absolution.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.17_2;Donate and your sins will be absolved.;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.18_1_desc;The townsfolk cheered and praised your reading and agreed with everything you said.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.18_2_desc;The townsfolk were not impressed and a loud crowd of boos soon followed.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.18_1;Go spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.18_2;I already have an headache.;;;;;;x

rtp_ancient_text_mission_tooltip;Find the ancient text;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.19_desc;My [Root.GetSisterBrother], I have a proposal which might interest you. An old letter detailing the possible locations of some lost ancient texts came into my possession not many moons ago. I can fund the expedition and both you and [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] can search for one of these treasures together!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.19_1;ACCEPT;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.19_2;DECLINE;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.20_title;The Ancient Text;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.20_desc;After clearing [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHis] throat, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] begins speaking. "The letter mentioned three lost texts: a tome in a local antiquary, a scroll hidden in a cave in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName], and a tablet in an ancient library ruins in [rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName]. I let you decide which one we should go after.";;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.20_1;Let us go for the tome.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.20_2;Let us go for the scroll.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.20_3;Let us go for the tablet.;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.21_title;The Ancient Text;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_1_desc;When we found the engraved door to the chamber, we could hardly believe our eyes. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] and I had nearly given up. That day would be the very last of our search, we had decided, so our discovery must surely have been a divine miracle! Something reflected the light from deep within the chamber, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]'s breaths were quick and shallow. 'It.... it cannot be!";;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_2_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] insisted that we must have misinterpreted the map. After every failure, [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] had a new idea. A suspicion crept upon me... What if the map was forged, and [Root.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName] knew? Was the blasted expedition a plot to ruin me?!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_3_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days on end we did nothing but breathe dust and leaf through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! On the fourth day, I was thus incredibly surprised to lay my eyes on the symbols of the tome!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_4_desc;[rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days at end we did nothing but breathe dust and page through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! After a week, we had to admit defeat. We would never uncover anything of worth in this place.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_5_desc;Our expedition into the ruins of the library encountered some difficulties, but in the end we made it to the ruins of [rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName] safely. After a fortnight of excavation we uncovered the entrance to a hidden underground chamber. [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] and I entered side by side, the air heavy with excitement.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_6_desc;Our expedition into foreign lands certainly encountered its fair share of difficulties. We dealt with everything from unfavorable weather to lame horses, but in the end, the fraudulent guide was the nail in the coffin. We discovered that we were in the wrong part of [rtp_society_quest_target.Liege.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_1;We found it!;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.21_2;Waste of time really.;;;;;;x

rtp_the_foundation_of_lies_mission_tooltip;Help $TARGET$ with the project;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.22_desc;A local noble by the name of [rtp_society_quest_target.GetLordLady] [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName] is asking us to assist [rtp_society_quest_target.GetHerHim] with a project. The strange thing is that they decided to contact [Root.Society.GetName] instead of one of the many other guilds. This suggests that they require your mind, rather than your arm. Interested in checking it out?;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.22_1;ACCEPT;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.22_2;DECLINE;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.23_title;The Foundation of Lies;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.23_desc;You arrive at [rtp_society_quest_target.GetLordLady] [rtp_society_quest_target.GetFirstName]’s court and [rtp_society_quest_target.GetSheHe] greets you cordially. “I am in dire need of your help,” stated the [rtp_society_quest_target.GetLordLady], “and I need you to find out why the construction of the new stables has halted”. “I cannot receive a straight answer from anyone I have working on the project.";;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.23_1;I will find the problem my [rtp_society_quest_target.GetLordLady].;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.24_title;The Foundation of Lies;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.24_desc;Upon arriving at the stables you see a group of men arguing with each other. As you get closer to the crowd, you notice the architect and the foreman arguing amongst each other. “I am telling you from my years of experience this beam cannot hold this weight!” yells the foreman as you approach them. You raise your hand and the crowd quiets down.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.24_1;Speak one at a time please.;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.25_title;The Foundation of Lies;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.25_desc;You decide to talk with the foreman first. He is clearly agitated as he shows the beams in question. “You see the beams have enough weight on them as it is but this so called architect wants to add another level above without support!” - “My years of building tells me this is too much and will lead to disaster later on” he explains.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.25_1;Perhaps;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.26_title;The Foundation of Lies;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.26_desc;You begin talking with the architect and you can feel that something in his tone of voice is off. “I apprenticed under the best architect, and that slobbering bastard dares to question me? Why should I...”. You cut him off with a strong tone “where are the plans for the stables?”. He hands you the plans and you begin going over them. This cannot be! -- you think to yourself.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.26_1;Explain yourself!;;;;;;x

RTPlsociety.27_title;The Foundation of Lies;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.27_desc;“Look, nothing bad is going to happen, I just thought if I skimped on a few materials I could pocket the extra gold for those materials” he explained. “Obviously you are way too smart for this type of charade, so how about I cut you in the gold I collected. Listen...just follow along with me and let us keep this a secret?”;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.27_1;Give me half and you got a deal.;;;;;;x
RTPlsociety.27_2;What do you take me for?!?;;;;;;x
