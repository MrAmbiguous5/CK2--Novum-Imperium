# Settlement decisions are possible vs _all_ settlements and are shown in the Settlement Diplomacy View, not the Intrigue View. The taker is in the FROM scope.

# filter = [capital/owned/vassal_owned/sub_realm_owned/realm_owned/dynasty_owned/all]
# ai_target_filter = [capital/owned/vassal_owned/sub_realm_owned/realm_owned/dynasty_owned/all] (which settlements for which the AI evaluates the decision.)
#	owned: all settlements owned by the AI
#	vassal_owned: all settlements owned by direct vassal rulers of the AI's employer
#	sub_realm_owned: all settlements below the AI's employer
#	realm_owned: all settlements in the same top realm as the AI
#	dynasty_owned: all settlements owned by members of the same dynasty
#	all: all settlements (Avoid if possible. VERY CPU-HEAVY!)
